NEURID is an Al-powered embedded system for detecting electricity theft, balancing transformer loads, and forecasting faults in real-time. It uses ESP32 nodes with sensors along a feeder line and a smart relay controlled via Al. A 92%-accurate LSTM model runs on Raspberry Pi 5, enabling live anomaly detection without cloud access. Designed for rural grids and urban complexes, NEURID boosts grid reliability, transparency, and safety.
